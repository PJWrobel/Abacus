# Abacus
[![Version] 1]
Yet Another Compiled Static Type Language

Abacus is a [WIP] hobby language with the goal to provide a modern toolset to experienced C developers, seemlessly transpile to C as to not hide complexity or behavior, and bi-directional integration of libraries from one language to the other. The -L compiler option allows for transpilation to a C library that can be seemlessly integrated to existing projects.
